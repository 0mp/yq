yq: Command-line YAML processor - jq wrapper for YAML documents
===============================================================

Installation
------------
::

    pip install yq

Before using ``yq``, you also have to install its dependency, ``jq``. See the `jq installation instructions
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/>`_ for details and directions specific to your platform.

Synopsis
--------

yq's mode of operation is very basic: it transcodes YAML on standard input to JSON and pipes it to ``jq``, while passing
all of its command line options to jq.

.. code-block:: bash

    cat input.yml | yq .foo.bar

See the `jq manual <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_ for more details on jq features and options.
